## Two Years with Gardyn 3.0

I purchased a Gardyn 3.0 during the Black Friday sale of 2023. Why? Winters are hard up here in the PNW. I wanted to try to double up and benefit from gardening and the full spectrum light. I also wanted some healthier snacks on hand that I didn't have to worry about. What was my garden experience before this? I had murdered all my house plants save one pothos I amanged to keep alive for a six months (it's still around and thriving). 

TLDR: Would I buy again? Yes.

### Let's talk about the subscription

#### Credits

You get 10 credits a month. Most plants are one credit. Fruits tend to be two or three. Are you going to go through 10 heads of lettuce in a month? You know, you might. This is probably the only full use of the credits. It you go 100% lettuce. Even, I'd find it wasteful only using the (compostible) y-cubes only once. I have been saving mine. After my initial one year of membership and a full year beyond, I have twenty unused y-cubes some of which are from the original starter kit. I also still have 35 reclaimed y-cubes. Seeing as I have transitioned my Gardyn to longer lived plants, I likely have two plus years of y-cubes on hand now. So, four years of y-cubes from one year of membership. I also used my credits to buy plant food heavily towards the end. I have roughly two full Gardyn bottles of veg + bloom. 

Suggestion: If you buy a year subscription, use your credits to buy plant food every other month.

#### Kelby

If you forget to take the covers off your y-cubes, Kelby will let you know. Other than that... Don't hold your breath. The app has seen some big changes kind of recently lending more to a gamification which--I'll admit--I like better. The fact that it is essentially pay to win is obnoxious. Certain things that affect your score are only available with the membership. Not sure if it's good or bad but my Gardyn currently has an 86 sans Kelby. 

What was I hoping for? Well, as someone that had never grown food before I was bound to miss some things. Like the first time lettuce bolted. I didn't realize that I should harvest it before it gets to far along. Not a word from Kelby. The time a column was disconnected and all the plants started to die? Yeah, Kelby also didn't alert me that they weren't looking healthy which was unfortunate because I was out of town... Temperature alerts as well would be nice. As in, hey guy your greens are gonna go limp if you don't cool it down. Nothing. Once, while I was growing Fairy Tale Eggplant (which was listed as discontinued; I ordered some seeds) it did randomly give me advice on handling egg plant flowers. That was cool and in line with my expectations. But it only happened when using a product they no longer offered...

### Chlorine is an Asshole!

I have tried a lot to keep my strawberries happy--they're so needy! But still some level of rot seems to creep into their roots eventually. I added an aeration pump. No change. I had been using Hydroponic Research Life+ priobiotics which seemed to help a bit. Sometimes. And then I stepped it up to Hydroguard which definitely helped but not as much as I expected. And then I realized I was being an idiot: my tap water is treated with chlorine. I was murdering my probiotics. Mid-week additions were the extent of the real contribution to the plant's biome. I run an aeration pump and stir my tank occassionally for two hours prior adding nutrients or balancing ph. This is mostly to protect the existing organisms colonizing the roots. I then wait until the following morning to add fresh Hydroguard. This seems to be helping.

Combing fruiting plants and greens seems like an easy win. But you'll quickly

### Fruiting Optimizations

If you're like me and want to really want to get the most snacks, you're gonna want to buy an EC and PH meter. I scoffed at this for the better part of two years due to the inaccuracy of the affordable models. But, in the end, it boils down to a tool that is 80% accurate is still vastly superior to shooting in the dark.
